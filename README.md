# INFO-2200
UVU INFO-2200 Spring 2019  
This repository is used to store the C# applications made for my INFO2200 (Computer Program II for IS IT) class at Utah Valley University. 
Most files are simple desktop apps created using windows forms or a console for the front end. The others are mobile apps that used Xamrin to generate cross platform mobile apps.
